This application is capable of splitting python code into segments by type of classes, functions, imports, and so on, after which you can get a screenshot of the code of the selected segment.  
You can copy or save the received images to the selected folder.  
If the code is too large, it will be split into several screenshots, which you can combine if you check the "Concatenate Screenshots" box.  
You can also choose the font and style of the code that will be in the screenshot.
